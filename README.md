## Features:

- üí• Selection of the wg-easy installation mode: standard, or via a proxy to the XRay server using sing-box.

- üì¶ Adding and removing wg-easy containers via the script menu, with all necessary settings applied automatically.

- üåê Adding, modifying, and deleting a domain name (requires setting an A record in your domain registrar's panel pointing to your server's IP address).

- üíª Automatic deployment of the Caddy web server as a reverse proxy with auto-renewing SSL certificate.

- üîë Changing the password for the wg-easy web interface(s), proxy manager for previously created services.

- üöÄ Optimized network settings on both the server host and within the containers.

## Requirements:

1. A VPS server with minimal specifications: at least 1 GB of RAM, running Linux Ubuntu 24.04+ or Debian 12+ OS, with an IPv4 address and kernel version 6+. (Two servers are required if you need XRay for proxying with a free port 443 on it)
2. Operation and startup via SSH as the root user.

## Installation:

From under ssh, install the main script `wg-easy-breezy`

```
curl -fsSLO "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jinndi/wg-easy-breezy/main/wg-easy-breezy?t=$(date +%s)" && bash wg-easy-breezy
```
