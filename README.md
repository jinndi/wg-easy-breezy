## Features:

- üí• Selecting the installation mode for wg-easy: either standard or via a Shadowsocks proxy to another server using tun2socks.

- üß¶ Creating a Shadowsocks server (Rust implementation) using the `ss-easy-breezy` script and obtaining a link to specify in the `wg-easy-breezy` script.

- üì¶ Adding and removing wg-easy containers via the script menu, with all necessary settings applied automatically.

- üåê Adding, modifying, and deleting a domain name (requires setting an A record in your domain registrar's panel pointing to your server's IP address).

- üöÄ Automatic deployment of the Caddy web server as a reverse proxy with auto-renewing SSL certificate.

- üîë Changing the password for the wg-easy web interface(s).

- ‚ö°Ô∏è Optimized network settings on both the server host and within the containers.

## Requirements:

1. A VPS server with at least 1 GB of RAM, running Linux (Ubuntu 24.04+ or Debian 12+), with an IPv4 address and a kernel version ‚â• 6. (You‚Äôll need two servers if you want to deploy the Shadowsocks server separately.)
2. Access and execution via SSH as the root user.

## Installation:

From under ssh, install the main script `wg-easy-breezy`

```
curl -fsSLO -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" -H "Pragma: no-cache" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jinndi/wg-easy-breezy/main/wg-easy-breezy && bash wg-easy-breezy
```

Follow the on-screen instructions. You will be prompted to enter the following:

- **Choosing a language**  
  Choose one of the following:
  - English
  - Russian

- **Installation mode**  
  Choose one of the following:
  - Standard
  - Proxy via Shadowsocks

- **Service tag**  
  Used as a postfix in service names, container names, and web interface URLs.

- **Domain name**  
  Optional ‚Äî used to secure access to the web interface via HTTPS.  
  *(Can be set later through the menu.)*

- **Email address**  
  Required if a domain name is provided ‚Äî used by the Caddy server to obtain an SSL certificate.

- **Shadowsocks link**  
  Required if proxy mode is selected.  
  
  You can obtain it by installing `ss-easy-breezy` on another server commander:

  ```
  curl -fsSLO -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" -H "Pragma: no-cache" https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jinndi/wg-easy-breezy/main/ss-easy-breezy && bash ss-easy-breezy
  ```
  Installation directory: `/opt/shasowsocks-rust/`
  
  The installed server is managed using the `sseb` command

- **WireGuard port**  
  Choose any port from the suggested range.  
  *(The web interface will use the next port number.)*

- **WireGuard client address range**  
  In the format used by `wg-easy`, e.g.:  
  `10.0.0.x`, `10.1.0.x`, etc.

- **Web interface password**  
  Will be automatically encoded and saved to the `.env` file.

After the installation is complete, you will receive a link to the web interface.

Installation directory: `/opt/wg-easy-breezy/`

The installed server is managed using the `wgeb` command
